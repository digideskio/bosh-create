# bosh-create

This project is an exploration of how we can create BOSH Releases and everything
within them in a manner which is easy to follow logically, debuggable and 
straight forward to use.

Once we have what we believe is a good clean pattern for bosh releases satisfying
the above we will be converting this to a compiled project for multiple operating 
systems for ease of installation.

Ideas and suggestions welcome!
